      Executes a batch script that performs actions on the OneNote object model.
      When the promise is resolved, any tracked objects that were automatically
      allocated during execution will be released.

          description: >
            A function that takes in a RequestContext and returns a promise
            (typically, just the result of "context.sync()"). The context
            parameter facilitates requests to the OneNote application. Since the
            Office add-in and the WoOneNote application run in two different
            processes, the request context is required to get access to the
            OneNote object model from the add-in.
