      Track a new object for automatic adjustment based on surrounding changes
      in the document. Only some object types require this. If you are using an
      object across ".sync" calls and outside the sequential execution of a
      ".run" batch, and get an "InvalidObjectPath" error when setting a property
      or invoking a method on the object, you needed to have added the object to
      the tracked object collection when the object was first created.

      Release the memory associated with an object that was previously added to
      this collection. Having many tracked objects slows down the host
      application, so please remember to free any objects you add, once you're
      done using them. You will need to call "context.sync()" before the memory
      release takes effect.
